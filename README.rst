RAUC hawkBit Client
===================

|license| |build-status| |coverage-status| |docs-status|

The RAUC hawkBit client is a simple python-based library and example
application that runs on your target and operates as an interface between the
`RAUC <https://github.com/rauc/rauc>`_ D-Bus API
and the `hawkBit <https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit>`_ DDI API.

Quickstart
----------

Despite the rauc-hawkbit client is primarily meant to be used as a library,
it also provides a simple example application that allows you to instantly
start with a small configuration file.

To quickly build and start a hawkBit server, follow
`this <https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit#build-and-start-hawkbit-update-server>`_
instruction.

Then setup your configuration file:

.. code-block:: ini

  [client]
  hawkbit_server = 127.0.0.1:8080
  ssl = false
  tenant_id = DEFAULT
  target_name = test-target
  auth_token = bhVahL1Il1shie2aj2poojeChee6ahShu
  mac_address = 12:34:56:78:9A:BC
  bundle_download_location = /tmp/bundle.raucb

Finally start the client application:

.. code-block:: sh

  ./rauc-hawkbit-client -c config.cfg

Background
----------
Work on the RAUC hawkBit client started at `Pengutronix
<http://pengutronix.de/>`_ in the middle of 2016 as part of a customer's project
and for demonstration purposes. In May 2017 the decision was made to restructure
and clean up the code and publish it as Open Source software.

Example Usage
-------------

The ``RaucDBUSDDIClient`` class from the ``rauc_hawkbit`` module allows you to
simply setup an interface between RAUC and hawkBit.

.. code-block:: python

  from rauc_hawkbit.rauc_dbus_ddi_client import RaucDBUSDDIClient

  ...

  async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
      client = RaucDBUSDDIClient(session, HOST, SSL, TENANT_ID, TARGET_NAME,
                                 AUTH_TOKEN, ATTRIBUTES, BUNDLE_DL_LOCATION,
                                 result_callback, step_callback)
      await client.start_polling()

If you only want use the hawkBit interface from your python project, you can
use the DDIClient class.

.. code-block:: python

   from rauc_hawkbit.ddi.client import DDIClient

   ...

   ddi = DDIClient(session, host, ssl, auth_token, tenant_id, target_name)
   base = await self.ddi()

   if '_links' in base:
       if 'configData' in base['_links']:
           await self.identify(base)


Debugging
---------

When setting the log level to 'debug' the RAUC hawkBit client will print API
URLs and JSON payload sent and received. This can be done either by setting
``log_level`` from the config file

.. code-block:: ini

  [client]
  ...
  log_level = debug

or by providing the ``-d`` (``--debug``) switch when calling the client.

.. code-block:: sh

  ./rauc-hawkbit-client -d
